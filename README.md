Very happy to see you here 🤓.
My name is Syakirah, but you can also call me Sjaak 🦄! I am a junior front en developer with a big interest in design and problem solving.
I like to help people by making apps that can improve peoples life (and look attractive). Currently I am looking for new challenge as a junior developer, by joining a developer team remote or in (near) Amsterdam 🌷🇳🇱
